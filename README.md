# YahooSigninAutomationTestProject
This project will test Yahoo sign in module parallelly with negative and positive dataâ€™s using Automation Testing technology such as Selenium, Eclipse IDE, Java Programming language, TestNG Framework, Chrome and Firefox WebDriver, Selenium Grid. I used my own Windows 10 desktop computer as a Hub and also as a Node but with 2 different ports.
The purpose of this project is to showcase my knowledge base on what I learned from self studying Selenium WebDriver to pursue a career in Automation Testing.
